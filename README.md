# Hackathon-Toilet

4-hour Toilet Hackathon at Aarhus University arranged by Pressalit A/S and Happy42.

Our solution targeted toilets at schools and other public areas as many young students choose not to use them. Therefore we made a game out of using the toilets by playing sounds when using the toilet. The sounds where played at different events registred by ultrasonic sensors connected to a Raspberry Pi.
